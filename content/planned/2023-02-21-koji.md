Title: Fedora Build System
Date: 2024-02-21 21:00+0000
Ticket: 11778

koji will be upgraded to 1.34.0, which requires a schema update that touches many rows.
We estimate this will take about 45minutes to complete and during that time, koji will be completely offline.
Package maintainers are advised to not start any long term builds before the outage.
This outage affects[koji](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji) and [bodhi](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/).
